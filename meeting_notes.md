# Meeting Notes
## 13 January 2022
- **project goal**: predict the power of a target wind turbine based on reference turbines
- wind speed is not always a useful predictor since there is so much variability and uncertainty involved in its measurement
- standard minimum is 4 target wind turbines and 4 reference wind turbines
- data is recorded with 10 minute resolution (the average of each 10 minute interval)

## Upcoming Meeting: TBD
