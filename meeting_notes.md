# Important Dates
- **18 February** interim presentation
- **16 March 17:00** project report submission deadline

# Tasks
## Alex
- [x] fill out the corrected [doodle poll](https://doodle.com/poll/envaniqyhsn8crah?utm_source=poll&utm_medium=link)
- [x] implement most basic model of predicting wind turbine power. Take weighted average of all other wind turbines at given timestep. Weight according to relative distance. General and efficient code, can be easily extended

## Billy

## Mary
- [x] create doodle poll
- [x] fix zoom meeting issues
- [x] correct time zone on doodle poll
- [x] fill out the corrected [doodle poll](https://doodle.com/poll/envaniqyhsn8crah?utm_source=poll&utm_medium=link)

## tbd
- [ ] determine and develop an approach to testing method accuracy
- [ ] tweak weighting function
- [ ] tweak nonlinearity function $f(power)$
- [ ] incorporate wind direction
- [ ] incorporate neighboring times
- [ ] learn how to determine reference turbines

# Meeting Notes
## 13 January 2022
- **project goal**: predict the power of a target wind turbine based on reference turbines
- wind speed is not always a useful predictor since there is so much variability and uncertainty involved in its measurement
- standard minimum is 4 target wind turbines and 4 reference wind turbines
- data is recorded with 10 minute resolution (the average of each 10 minute interval)

## Upcoming Meeting: TBD
### Questions
- What's the difference between the ARD data and CAU data?
- Where is the wind farm?
    - Can we visit it? ðŸ˜‡
- Is there a disadvantage to using all non-target turbines as references?
